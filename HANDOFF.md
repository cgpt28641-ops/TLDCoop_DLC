# TLDCoop_DLC: handoff for the next assistant (30.10.2026, updated 17:35)

## The user
- Karol, Polish (in-game name "Kerel_007_"). Write to him in Polish, short and simple. If he writes "krótko", answer in a few lines.
- He plays co-op with the host "Shatsca" and with "szymongrzyb2017".
- He is not a programmer. He runs whatever you give him and replies "gotowe" or "zrobione", sometimes sending logs or screenshots.
- He wants ready-made zips from GitHub Actions artifacts. Give him a link, not build instructions.
- Implement items from a list only when he tells you to. Once he says "rób wszystko", you can work on your own.
- When you send him a list of changes, mark each item: `[ZROBIONE - do testu]`, `[CZESCIOWO]` or `[NIE ZROBIONE]`.

## Project
- The repo is private: **cgpt28641-ops/TLDCoop_DLC**, branch `main`.
- It is a co-op mod for The Long Dark with all DLC, **game version 2.59 189140 S** (`kTestedGameVersion` in `src/core.cpp`).
- **Design:**
  - A C++ DLL loaded as a winhttp proxy, using IL2CPP and MinHook.
  - The network protocol is in `src/net/protocol.h`, **currently v34**. Every player must run the same build.
  - CI runs on windows-latest with MSVC. Compile errors come back as annotations, and the artifact is the zip.
- **Checking it locally (Linux):**
  - Syntax: `clang++ -fsyntax-only -I<stub dir with windows.h>`.
  - Pure tests: `g++ -std=c++20 -Isrc tests/*_test.cpp`.
- **Logs:**
  - `coop.log`, rotated to `coop-prev.log` and `coop-prev2.log`.
  - `[FAULT]` lines give the crash location as module+offset.
- **Disabling the mod:** create an empty file named `disabled` in the TLDCoop folder.
- **Config:** `coop.ini`, with sections [net] (includes `backups=`), [colors] (e.g. `Shatsca=blue`) and [emotes] (keys).

## Done so far (most of it NOT yet tested in co-op)
- **v32:**
  - Match and flare light in hand.
  - The striking-a-light animation.
  - Flare burn time synced.
  - A thrown flare is sent while still in flight.
  - Cooking cans and melting snow are synced: opened state, host sync every 5 s.
  - Player colours.
  - The map updates live.
  - Animals within 250 m of any player are driven by the AI (they no longer freeze).
  - Locking a decoration while someone moves it.
  - Gestures F5–F8, F3 and F4.
- **v33:** other players see your blood trails (Msg BloodMark = 41, `src/world_blood.*`).
- **v34:**
  - Save backups (`TLDCoop\backups\<date>`, keeps 5).
  - Shared spray-paint markers (Msg SprayMark = 42).
  - A friend's condition and afflictions shown under their name tag within 5 m (State.condition, afflictions).
- **Fixes:**
  - Host crash when searching a backpack or car (`m_GearToInstantiate` is a `List<string>`). Confirmed fixed.
  - Crash when quitting (Steam DLLs are now pinned).
  - The breakdown ring was missing (hook on the time-acceleration HUD in `src/coop_lapse.cpp`).
- **Full list for the user:** `TLDCoop_DLC_lista_poprawek.txt` (items 1–19). Not done:
  - 10 and 11: Iron Road train and Iron Road unique items, postponed by agreement.
  - 17: no ring when breaking things down.
  - Minimap and players drifting out of place: cause unknown. Needs screenshots plus coop.log.

## Current work: clothes on the avatars (state at 30.10, 17:35)
**Goal:** other players see what you wear, and it has to look realistic and professional ("perfekcyjnie"). Karol judges from the preview images and screenshots; he wants every item kept ("nic nie usuwamy") and made right.

**Decisions so far**
- Only 3 bodies get clothes and are choosable in the mod: **mackenzie_indoor, astrid, molly** (default mackenzie_indoor). Done in the mod: `avatar::choosable_body_ids`, coop menu + death screen, ini fallback (CI run 41043842291 OK).
- **The mod itself is NOT changed for clothes yet** (Karol chose "1": work only in the tool, integrate later when he says so).
- Base body: the character's own clothes hidden + a base layer (charcoal thermal top `TLDCoop_BaseTop` from FleeceSweater, LongUnderwear, WoolSocks). Nude bodies are impossible (no skin under the game's clothes).
- Balaclava: whole head and neck covered, only eyes and mouth visible (his reference: tube mask with eye/mouth holes).

**Assets:** Hinterland's art – only for friends who own the game; never publish, never in the repo. `.bodycut` files (game meshes) live only on Karol's PC (`D:\TLDCoop_Ubrania\bodycut`) and in the scratchpad.

**Tool:** `clothespack/` in the repo = `D:\TLDCoop_Ubrania` on Karol's PC.
- `build_clothes.cmd` → Unity 6000.0.60f1 batchmode: `TLDCoop.BuildClothes.Build` (bundle `tldcoop_clothes`, ~87 MB, 3 chars × ~67 items) and `TLDCoop.BuildClothes.Preview` (`previews/sheet_<char>.jpg` full body, `close_<char>.jpg` head+shoulders; 21 outfit columns from `preview_outfits`, rows front/side/back, cell 400×600; logs `build.log`, `preview.log`).
- Input: catalog `TLD_Odziez_Pelny_Katalog/characters/<char>/GEAR_*.gltf` (skinned to each NPC rig); Molly uses Astrid's fits (`fit_from molly:astrid`).
- `tools/bodycut/` (own UnityFS/LZ4/typetree parser) splits each body by bone region → `.bodycut`; Unity builds `<char>/BodyCut.asset` + `BodyCut.txt` (parts `sub:region`, incl. eyes, mouth, bands, and `hairtop` split at the hat rim).
- `Editor/BuildClothes.cs` (~121 KB) main steps per item: read glTF (mirror x) → reshape / SkinMask (balaclava) / Scarf / Beanie / SockSweep → collar, shorten → SliceFit + Radial (vests) → Wrap ×2 + ClampLayer (layer min/max over the base surface) → baked AO → mesh + txt (bones, materials, cut regions). Shader `Shaders/TLDCoopCloth.shader` (two-sided, normal from colour, AO, depth offset by layer).
- `clothes.json` holds all settings (layers, collar, hide_rules, base_hide incl. `neck@Mackenzie_Ep5_Body`, reshape for EarMuffs, sock_items/sock_from/boot_items, beanie_items, scarf_items, slice_fit_items, skin_mask_items…).

**Workflow**
1. Edit in `/home/claude/tldcoop_dlc`, commit + push (append to this file each time), copy changed files to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/clothes_vNN/` and write them to `D:\TLDCoop_Ubrania\…` with `device_commit_files`.
2. **Verify the write** (`device_list_dir` size/mtime; if the size is the same, stage the file back and grep it – once an old cached copy was written; a fresh staging folder fixed it).
3. Karol runs `build_clothes.cmd` and writes "gotowe" (or "błąd" → read `build.log`, look for `error CS`).
4. Stage previews/logs with `device_stage_files`, crop with PIL, look, fix.
- Git: repo remote URL is lowercase `tldcoop_dlc` (GitHub redirects; pushes occasionally fail with a server error – just retry, check `git status -sb`). Commit identity set to Claude/noreply.
- Offline helper: `scratchpad/ana/vsim.py` (base + tee + vest simulation with a software rasterizer).

**Current look (after v45/v46)**
- OK: coats, shirts, sweaters, trousers, boots, cap, rabbit hat, ear warmer (on the ears, round the back), scarves (flat bands round the neck over the collar), beanies (fitted to the skull, hair inside hidden, nape/ponytail visible), balaclava (whole head, beard flattened under it), vests on Astrid/Molly, no socks drawn under footwear, socks as clean knitted tubes.
- Open: v46 sock ankle position (not seen yet); Mackenzie DownVest dark collar shards, Mackenzie InsulatedVest tee patch on the shoulder, small dark points at DownVest armholes from behind; bear coat / wolf cape grey gaps between fur pieces; scarf hanging end straight/stiff.

## Next steps
1. Check v46 previews (socks from the side), then the open items above.
2. When Karol approves: **mod integration (protocol v35)** – load `tldcoop_clothes.bundle` next to the DLL; send each player's worn items; dress the avatar on the cut body (BodyCut parts, bones by name, rootBone `Hips_jnt`); apply `rules.txt` (hide words / cut regions), `base_hide` (incl. `region@material` syntax), the `hairtop` split, and "no socks under boot_items"; tests in `tests/`, README/INSTALL_DLC.txt.
3. Give friends the bundle privately (not on GitHub).
4. Test v32–v34 features in co-op; later Iron Road, gesture animations, minimap mismatch.

## Standing rule (Karol, 30.10 15:16)
**After every change, append a dated entry to this file** (what changed, why, status: tested on preview or not), and commit it with the change.

## Clothes log (30.10 afternoon, newest last)
Pipeline recap: base body = character's own clothes hidden (base_hide regions) + base layer (TLDCoop_BaseTop from FleeceSweater, LongUnderwear, WoolSocks); every other piece wraps over BaseSurface by layer (`layers` min/max in clothes.json). Previews: `previews/close_<char>.jpg` (head+shoulders) and `sheet_<char>.jpg`, 21 outfit columns (see `preview_outfits`), rows front/side/back, cell 400×600.

- **v32–v33** – balaclava = SkinMask (head skin offset 6 mm, eyes/mouth holes) + skull shell + neck tube; vest SliceFit. Tested: OK.
- **v34** – scarves snug round the neck; knitted pieces (balaclava/scarves/beanies) get only a light baked AO (0.8–1.0) – dark blotches came from hair the game hides. Tested.
- **v35** – scarves = flat knitted bands (2 turns, 4.8 cm tall × 2.2 cm), over the coat collar (layer min 0.028), hanging end on top. Balaclava shell fitted per head from BodyCut (eyes height/front, head extents incl. hair), closed over the forehead, neck tube raised. Fixed CS0136 (`thick`→`depth`). Tested: balaclava covers the whole head on all 3, scarves round the neck – Karol OK.
- **v36** – white patches = inner layers poking through outer ones. Added `ClampLayer` (last per-vertex pass, no smoothing: push ≤3 cm, pull ≤5 cm below neck−0.025). Base top made charcoal (`GreyCopy` → `_thermal` texture, 0.2+0.42·lum). Tested: Astrid/Molly clean.
- **v37** – Mackenzie still had white on shoulders: his own shirt sits in the body's **neck** region (x ±0.1, down to 1.56 m). `base_hide` now supports `region@materialword`; added `neck@Mackenzie_Ep5_Body`. **Mod integration must honour this syntax too.** Tested (v38 build): fixed.
- **v38** – depth bias by layer in TLDCoop/Cloth (`Offset [_OffsetFactor],[_OffsetUnits]`, set from the piece's layer min: −wrap·100, −wrap·2000); tops max 0.009, vests min 0.02. Hair hidden under beanies (BasicWoolHat, Toque, ImprovisedHat). Tested: hair OK (Molly shows a bit of pale nape under the beanie – could lower the beanie at the back). Vests still bad.
- **v39** – vest cause: raw vests (yoke + standing collar) were left inside the torso above the armpits, so the shirt covered them → shredded look. SliceFit now also fits front/back depth above the armpits (cap ×1.45) and keeps the width factor of the last slice below the armpits. **Not yet seen on preview.**
- **v40** – EarMuffs is really a ring-shaped ear warmer band; it covered the face. Reshape got `tilt`, `back_only`, `cut_front`: rotate_x 90, scale 0.85, centre (0, 0.075, −0.012), tilt 0.35 (back lower), front part beyond centre z+0.025 removed → on the ears and round the back of the head. **Not yet seen on preview.**

- **v40 result (15:21)** – ear warmer: on the ears and round the back – OK. Vests: better on Astrid, still shredded yoke/collar on Mackenzie and yellow shards on InsulatedVest. Hiding all hair under beanies showed holes in the scalp (eye backs visible from behind).
- **v41** – BodyCut splits hair-material triangles of the head at a hat rim (2.5 cm above the eyes at the front → 0.5 cm under them at the back) into a new part region `hairtop`; beanie hide rule now hides only `hairtop` (fringe, nape, ponytail stay). Vests taken out of `collar_items` (the collar squeeze crumpled their standing collar/yoke) – experiment. **Not yet seen on preview.** Mod integration: the `hairtop` part comes from BodyCut, so the runtime must use the same split.
- **v41 result (15:36)** – hair split at the beanie rim works (nape/ponytail stay, no scalp holes). Vests still bad above the armpits.
- **v42** – offline sim (`scratchpad/ana/vsim.py`: base fleece + tee + vest, slice fit + wrap) reproduced the vest problem: the nearest-normal push scatters the yoke at the shoulders. New `Radial()` (after SliceFit, slice-fit items only): above armpit−4 cm each vertex moves out along the ray from a spine point 10 cm under the armpits to `clearance` outside the farthest crossing of the base torso (triangles |x|<0.2, recorded in `BaseTris` when the base is built), faded in over 4 cm. Sim: yokes/collars now lie over the shirt (Astrid clean, Mackenzie much better). **Not yet seen on preview.**
- **v42 result (15:50)** – vests fixed on Astrid and Molly (yoke + collar over the shirt, BallisticVest clean on all). Left: Mackenzie DownVest dark collar shards, Mackenzie InsulatedVest grey tee patch on the shoulder (side), small dark points at the DownVest armholes from behind; Mackenzie's beanies look squat with hair bulging under the rim.
- **15:51 Karol:** balaclava (Mackenzie: knitted beard shape) and beanies (bowl/mushroom from the side) don't suit him; asked about trousers, boots, socks. Checked legs: trousers OK; base socks poke through boots at the toes; sock-only outfits look like flat grey/red paws (the catalog sock is a single flat ground model).
- **v43** –
  - `HeadFit(character)`: skull ellipsoid from BodyCut (eye height/front, skin extents above the eyes; hair added only when the scalp isn't modelled). Used by the balaclava shell (+6–8 mm) and now by **beanies** (+1.4 cm over the skull, crown +3 cm slack, rim eyes+3.5 cm front → eyes−2 cm back); hairtop split rim moved to the same line.
  - Balaclava: under the mouth the mask is flattened from the chin to the throat (beard stays inside, hidden).
  - **Socks** (`sock_items`, `sock_from: GEAR_BasicShoes`): made in the shape of the character's low shoes, 4 mm inside, one knitted material in the sock's colour (`Convert(..., sockColourFrom)`), no mirroring. `boot_items`: under any footwear no sock is drawn (preview does this; **the mod must too**).
  - **Not yet seen on preview.**
- **v43 result (16:04)** – beanies now fitted (proper knit hats on all 3), balaclava over Mackenzie's beard smooth. Socks were the shoe model recoloured (laces, sole visible) – not good; no socks under boots works.
- **v44** – `SockFromShoe()`: shoe welded (0.2 mm), small loose parts (laces etc. <25 % of the biggest) dropped, Taubin-smoothed 25 rounds, sole thickness (1.2 cm) taken off the bottom, normals from the smoothed faces, 5 mm inside. **Not yet seen on preview.**
- **v44 result (16:10)** – smoothed-shoe socks still wrong (flat heel panel, spikes from the heel tab).
- **v45** – `SockSweep()` replaces it: per foot, a knitted tube swept along a centre line (from 5 cm over the shoe's top down the ankle, quarter circle round the heel, forward along the sole to a rounded, closed toe), sized from the shoe on that side (heel/toe/width percentiles), each ring skinned like the nearest shoe vertex; ribbed UVs. `SockFromShoe()` left in the file, unused. **Not yet seen on preview.**
- **v45 result (16:16)** – swept socks look clean (knit, heel, round toe) but the ankle tube sat behind the shin.
- **v46** – SockSweep ankle line = middle of the shoe's opening (top 3 cm of the shoe), at least 3.5 cm in front of the heel. **Not yet seen on preview.**
- **v46 result (17:39)** – sock ankle now on the shin line (good from the side); from behind the long johns' leg showed through the sock top.
- **v47** – sock ankle tube wider at the top (r 5.3 cm → 4.4 cm at the heel) so the long johns' leg sits inside it. **Not yet seen on preview.**
